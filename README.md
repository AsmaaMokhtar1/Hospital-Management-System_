# Hospital Management System
# Hospital Management System

This is a console-based Hospital Management System written in C++ that allows managing patients, doctors, and appointments efficiently using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features
- **Patient Management:** Add, view, and update patient details.
- **Doctor Management:** Add, view, and update doctor information.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule and track appointments between patients and doctors.
- **Data Handling:** Efficient use of data structures like vectors and hash tables for fast access and organized storage.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Uses encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for maintainable and extensible code.

## Technical Highlights
- C++ programming language
- OOP principles
- Data structures: std::vector, hash tables
- Console-based interactive menu

## Future Improvements
- Add user authentication for doctors and patients.
- Implement a GUI interface using Qt or Tkinter (if using Python in the future).
- Include more advanced data structures for optimized performance with large datasets.
